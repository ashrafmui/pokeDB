# pokeDB
Pokemon Database Project

Deployed with Vercel at: https://pokedb-one.vercel.app/

This web app is built on the NEXT.js framework and uses TailwindCSS for styling and Typescript to build components. It calls on the PokeAPI for Pokemon data such as the sprites rendered on each of the generation buttons pages.
