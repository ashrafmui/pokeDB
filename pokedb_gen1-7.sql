COPY public."Ability" (id, name, effect, "shortEffect") FROM stdin;
1	overgrow	When this Pokémon has 1/3 or less of its HP remaining, its grass-type moves inflict 1.5× as much regular damage.	Strengthens grass moves to inflict 1.5× damage at 1/3 max HP or less.
2	chlorophyll	This Pokémon's Speed is doubled during strong sunlight. This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.	Doubles Speed during strong sunlight.
424	protean	Changes the bearer's type to match each move it uses. The type change takes place just before the move is used.	Changes the bearer's type to match each move it uses.
734	turboblaze	This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target. For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat. If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way. Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected. For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user. This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle. This ability cannot ignore multitype at all. An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used. For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed. When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability. This ability functions identically to mold breaker and teravolt.	Bypasses targets' abilities if they could hinder or prevent moves.
5	blaze	When this Pokémon has 1/3 or less of its HP remaining, its fire-type moves inflict 1.5× as much regular damage.	Strengthens fire moves to inflict 1.5× damage at 1/3 max HP or less.
6	solar-power	During strong sunlight, this Pokémon has 1.5× its Special Attack but takes 1/8 of its maximum HP in damage after each turn.	Increases Special Attack to 1.5× but costs 1/8 max HP after each turn during strong sunlight.

10	rain-dish	This Pokémon heals for 1/16 of its maximum HP after each turn during rain.	Heals for 1/16 max HP after each turn during rain.
13	shield-dust	This Pokémon is immune to the extra effects of moves used against it. An extra effect is a move's chance, listed as an "effect chance", to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.	Protects against incoming moves' extra effects.
14	run-away	This Pokémon is always successful fleeing from wild battles, even if trapped by a move or ability.	Ensures success fleeing from wild battles.
15	shed-skin	After each turn, this Pokémon has a 33% of being cured of any major status ailment.	Has a 33% chance of curing any major status ailment after each turn.
16	compound-eyes	This Pokémon's moves have 1.3× their accuracy. This ability has no effect on the one-hit KO moves (fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold).

21	sniper	This Pokémon inflicts triple damage with critical hits, rather than the usual double damage.	Strengthens critical hits to inflict 3× damage rather than 2×.
22	keen-eye	This Pokémon cannot have its accuracy lowered. This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate. This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap. Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.	Prevents accuracy from being lowered.
23	tangled-feet	When this Pokémon is confused, it has twice its evasion.	Doubles evasion when confused.
24	big-pecks	This Pokémon's Defense cannot be lowered by other Pokémon. This Pokémon can still be passed negative Defense modifiers through heart swap or guard swap.	Protects against Defense drops.

This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or magma armor.	Has a 30% chance of burning attacking Pokémon on contact.
735	teravolt	This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target. For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat. If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way. Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected. For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user. This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle. This ability cannot ignore multitype at all. An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used. For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed. When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability. This ability functions identically to mold breaker and turboblaze.

31	intimidate	When this Pokémon enters battle, the opponent's Attack is lowered by one stage. In a double battle, both opponents are affected. This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle. This ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute. Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.	Lowers opponents' Attack one stage upon entering battle.
34	static	Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being paralyzed. Pokémon that are immune to electric-type moves can still be paralyzed by this ability. Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, there is a 50% chance that encounters will be with an electric Pokémon, if applicable.	Has a 30% chance of paralyzing attacking Pokémon on contact.
35	lightning-rod	All other Pokémon's single-target electric-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target. Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it. If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected. When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon. follow me takes precedence over this ability. If the Pokémon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost.	Redirects single-target electric moves to this Pokémon where possible. Absorbs Electric moves, raising Special Attack one stage.
37	sand-veil	During a sandstorm, this Pokémon has 1.25× its evasion, and it does not take sandstorm damage regardless of type. The evasion bonus does not count as a stat modifier.

41	rivalry	This Pokémon inflicts 1.25× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the same gender and 0.75× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the opposite gender. If either Pokémon is genderless, damage is unaffected.	Increases damage inflicted to 1.25× against Pokémon of the same gender, but decreases damage to 0.75× against the opposite gender.
42	hustle	This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much regular damage, but have 0.8× their usual accuracy. Special moves are unaffected. Moves that do set damage, such as seismic toss, have their accuracy affected, but not their damage. Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.	Strengthens physical moves to inflict 1.5× damage, but decreases their accuracy to 0.8×.
187	volt-absorb	Whenever an electric-type move hits this Pokémon, it heals for 1/4 of its maximum HP, negating any other effect on it. This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves. Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute. This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. thunder wave.	Absorbs electric moves, healing for 1/4 max HP.
188	quick-feet	Whenever this Pokémon has a major status ailment, it has 1.5× its Speed. This Pokémon is not affected by the usual Speed cut from paralysis. Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved.	Increases Speed to 1.5× with a major status ailment.
48	cute-charm	Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being infatuated.

Has a 30% chance of infatuating attacking Pokémon on contact.
49	magic-guard	This Pokémon is immune to damage not directly caused by a move. For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from weather, recoil, status ailments, or spikes, but it still suffers from the Attack cut when burned, and a life orb will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it. Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, leech seed will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a jaboca berry or rowap berry will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon. The following are unaffected: struggle, pain split (whether used by or against this Pokémon), belly drum, substitute, curse, moves that knock the user out, and damage from confusion. This Pokémon will neither lose nor regain HP if it drains HP from a Pokémon with liquid ooze. If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn.	Protects against damage not directly caused by a move.
50	friend-guard	All friendly Pokémon take 0.75× as much direct damage from moves while this Pokémon is in battle. This effect stacks if multiple allied Pokémon have it.	Decreases all direct damage taken by friendly Pokémon to 0.75×.
52	flash-fire	This Pokémon is immune to fire-type moves. Once this Pokémon has been hit by a Fire move, its own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× as much damage until it leaves battle.

Once one has been blocked, the Pokémon's own Fire moves inflict 1.5× damage until it leaves battle.
53	drought	The weather changes to strong sunlight when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition. If multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, sand stream, or snow warning are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room. Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.	Summons strong sunlight that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle.
190	trace	When this Pokémon enters battle, it copies a random opponent's ability. This ability cannot copy flower gift, forecast, illusion, imposter, multitype, trace, wonder guard, or zen mode.	Copies an opponent's ability upon entering battle.

63	effect-spore	Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being paralyzed, poisoned, or put to sleep, chosen at random. Nothing is done to compensate if the move's user is immune to one of these ailments; there is simply a lower chance that the move's user will be affected.	Has a 30% chance of inflcting either paralysis, poison, or sleep on attacking Pokémon on contact.
64	dry-skin	This Pokémon takes 1/8 of its maximum HP in damage after each turn during strong sunlight, but it heals for 1/8 of its HP each turn during rain.

35	substitute	19	\N	\N	10	0	status	Transfers 1/4 the user’s max HP into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail. If the user leaves the field, the doll will vanish. If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail. The doll takes damage as normal, using the user’s stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero. Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed. Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal. Moves that work based on the user’s HP still do so; the doll’s HP does not influence any move. The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching. The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect. Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate. Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry. magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block. Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal. It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn. A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep. The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist. If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked. life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll. The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes. The doll is passed on by baton pass. It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon’s stats and types for damage calculation. All other effects work as normal.	Transfers 1/4 of the user’s max HP into a doll, protecting the user from further damage or status changes until it breaks.	user

37	curse	26	\N	\N	10	0	status	If the user is a ghost: user pays half its max HP to place a curse on the target, damaging it for 1/4 its max HP every turn. Otherwise: Lowers the user’s Speed by one stage, and raises its Attack and Defense by one stage each. The curse effect is passed on by baton pass. This move cannot be copied by mirror move.	Ghosts pay half their max HP to hurt the target every turn. Others decrease Speed but raise Attack and Defense.	specific-move
38	protect	19	\N	\N	10	4	status	No moves will hit the user for the remainder of this turn. If the user is last to act this turn, this move will fail. If the user successfully used detect, endure, protect, quick guard, or wide guard on the last turn, this move has a 50% chance to fail. lock on, mind reader, and no guard provide a (100 – accuracy)% chance for moves to break through this move. This does not apply to one-hit KO moves (fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold); those are always blocked by this move. thunder during rain dance and blizzard during hail have a 30% chance to break through this move. The following effects are not prevented by this move: * acupressure from an ally * curse’s curse effect * Delayed damage from doom desire and future sight; however, these moves will be prevented if they are used this turn * feint, which will also end this move’s protection after it hits * imprison * perish song * shadow force * Moves that merely copy the user, such as transform or psych up This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.

208	hidden-power	19	60	100	15	0	special	Inflicts regular damage. Power and type are determined by the user’s IVs. Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`. `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order. (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`. `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.) Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive. Average power is 49.5. Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0. (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.) The result is looked up in the following table. Value | Type ----: | -------- 0 | fighting 1 | flying 2 | poison 3 | ground 4 | rock 5 | bug 6 | ghost 7 | steel 8 | fire 9 | water 10 | grass 11 | electric 12 | psychic 13 | ice 14 | dragon 15 | dark This move thus cannot be normal.

6942	sword	It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.	727
6943	shield	Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well.	727
6944	sun	This Pokémon snorts body fluids from its nose, blowing balloons to smash into its foes. It’s famous for being a hard worker.	728
6945	moon	This Pokémon can control water bubbles. It practices diligently so it can learn to make big bubbles.	728
6946	ultra-sun	The balloons it inflates with its nose grow larger and larger as it practices day by day.	728
6947	ultra-moon	Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons to jump higher. It’s quite the acrobatic fighter!	728
6948	sword	It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer force of their bursting is what deals damage.	728
6949	shield	If Popplio want to create big, powerful balloons, they must be persistent. It takes daily practice for these Pokémon to develop their skills.	728
6950	sun	A skillful dancer, it creates a sequence of water balloons as it dances, and briskly bombards its enemies.	729
6951	moon	It cares deeply for its companions. When its Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery dance to try and help.	729
6952	ultra-sun	It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t know. This hard worker practices diligently until it can learn that dance.	729
6953	ultra-moon	It attacks by smacking its enemies with the exploding water balloons that it creates.	729
6954	sword	As if dancing, it artfully dodges the attacks of its enemies. All the while, it’s busy forming a bunch of balloons to overwhelm its foes.	729
6955	shield	On nights when the sea is calm, Brionne dance with one another to the singing of the Primarina that’s leading them.	729
6956	sun	It controls its water balloons with song. The melody is learned from others of its kind and is passed down from one generation to the next.	730
6957	moon	Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle. This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily maintenance of its throat at all costs.	730
6958	ultra-sun	To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing.	730
6959	ultra-moon	Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony in song.	730
6960	sword	With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound like beautiful singing. It uses the sonic waves to control its water balloons.	730
6961	shield	For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize the audience.	730
6962	sun	It can peck at a rate of 16 times a second to drill holes in trees. It uses the holes for food storage and for nesting.	731
6963	moon	This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it fires off from its mouth.	731
6964	ultra-sun	It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can get some idea of its mood or condition from the rhythm of its pecking.	731
6965	ultra-moon	It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times per second!	731
6966	sun	It eats berries and stores their seeds in its beak. When it encounters enemies or prey, it fires off all the seeds in a burst.	732
6967	moon	By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for its neighbors.	732
6968	ultra-sun	It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over a hundred different cries at will.	732
6969	ultra-moon	From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise to new plants.	732
6970	sun	When it battles, its beak heats up. The temperature can easily exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit, causing severe burns when it hits.	733
6971	moon	Within its beak, its internal gas ignites, explosively launching seeds with enough power to pulverize boulders.	733
6972	ultra-sun	They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.	733
6973	ultra-moon	Known for forming harmonious couples, this Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a good luck charm.	733
6974	sun	With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything. It did not originally live in Alola but was imported from another region.	734
6975	moon	It wanders around in a never-ending search for food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep on the spot.	734
6976	ultra-sun	Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter.	734
6977	ultra-moon	Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh living things, so it marches down streets in search of prey.	734
6978	sun	When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently stakes out the location...but it’s always snoozing by nightfall.	735
6979	moon	It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner, but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them. This Pokémon boasts incredible patience.	735
6980	ultra-sun	Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak.	735
6981	ultra-moon	Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—Rattata!	735
6982	sun	Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground.	736
6983	moon	They often gather near places frequented by electric Pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pokémon.	736
6984	ultra-sun	If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin.	736
6985	ultra-moon	It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down.	736
6986	sword	Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches.	736
6987	shield	It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap.	736
6988	sun	Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around.	737
6989	moon	From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac.	737
6990	ultra-sun	It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!	737
6991	ultra-moon	Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents.	737
6992	sword	While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws.	737
6993	shield	Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use.	737
6994	sun	It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening. It concentrates electrical energy within its large jaws and uses it to zap its enemies.	738
6995	moon	It produces electricity via an electrical organ in its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with shocking beams of electrical energy.	738
6996	ultra-sun	It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.	738
6997	ultra-moon	Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electric beam attack.	738
6998	sword	It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams.	738
6999	shield	If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity.	738
7000	sun	While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints.	739
7001	moon	It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious.	739
7002	ultra-sun	Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.	739
7003	ultra-moon	Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it.	739
7004	sun	It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur.	740
7005	moon	It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets.	740
7006	ultra-sun	It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!	740
7007	ultra-moon	Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches.	740
7008	sun	It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames.	741
7009	moon	This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its passionate dance moves cause its enemies to combust in both body and mind.	741
7010	ultra-sun	It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.	741
7011	ultra-moon	This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry.	741
7012	sun	It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers. Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify which flowers are about to bloom.	742
7013	moon	Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers.	742
7014	ultra-sun	Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food.	742
7015	ultra-moon	Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’ movements and make fools of them.	742
7016	sword	Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen.	742
7017	shield	An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back.	742
7018	sun	It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many different varieties, some used as food and others used in battle.	743
7019	moon	Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements.	743
7020	ultra-sun	Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still.	743
7021	ultra-moon	It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row.	743
7022	sword	It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar. The puffs’ effects depend on the type of ingredients and how much of each one is used.	743
7023	shield	Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy Galar region, they are very seldom seen.	743
7024	sun	It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up.	744
7025	moon	This Pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side.	744
7026	ultra-sun	As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.	744
7027	ultra-moon	When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that’s proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!	744
7028	sword	This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging.	744
7029	shield	This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks.	744
7030	sun	Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons.	745
7031	moon	When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer.	745
7032	ultra-sun	The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.	745
7033	ultra-moon	The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms.	745
7034	sword	This Lycanroc is calm and cautious. The rocks jutting from its mane are razor sharp.	745
7035	shield	With swift movements, this Pokémon gradually backs its prey into a corner. Lycanroc’s fangs are always aimed toward opponents’ weak spots.	745
7036	sun	When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies.	746
7037	moon	It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson.	746
7038	ultra-sun	They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school.	746
7039	ultra-moon	When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away.	746
7040	sword	Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents.	746
7041	shield	When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather.	746
7042	sun	It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.	747
7043	moon	It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon.	747
7044	ultra-sun	They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.	747
7045	ultra-moon	Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal.	747
7046	sword	The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.	747
7047	shield	Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious.	747
7048	sun	Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits scattered in its wake.	748
7049	moon	Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer intense pain for three days and three nights. Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects.	748
7050	ultra-sun	To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet.	748
7051	ultra-moon	With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable.	748
7052	sword	To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat.	748
7053	shield	Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect.	748
7054	sun	The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait.	749
7055	moon	It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine.	749
7056	ultra-sun	It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer.	749
7057	ultra-moon	Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine.	749
7058	sword	Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon. It’s skilled at making use of mud.	749
7059	shield	It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping.	749
7060	sun	It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it.	750
7061	moon	Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat.	750
7062	ultra-sun	It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.	750
7063	ultra-moon	It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load.	750
7064	sword	Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick.	750
7065	shield	Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep.	750
7066	sun	It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head.	751
7067	moon	When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them.	751
7068	ultra-sun	When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way.	751
7069	ultra-moon	It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land.	751
7070	sword	It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes.	751
7071	shield	Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head.	751
7072	sun	It delivers headbutts with the water bubble on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into the bubble, where they drown.	752
7073	moon	Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon, it protectively brings them into its water bubble.	752
7074	ultra-sun	It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head.	752
7075	ultra-moon	It has a habit of storing things it values in its water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out, Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!	752
7076	sword	It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning prey within the bubbles. This Pokémon can then take its time to savor its meal.	752
7077	shield	It acts as a caretaker for Dewpider, putting them inside its bubble and letting them eat any leftover food.	752
7078	sun	During the day, it sleeps and soaks up light. When night falls, it walks around looking for a safer place to sleep.	753
7079	moon	They give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where Fomantis are hiding.	753
7080	ultra-sun	When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its head has a pleasant aroma.	753
7081	ultra-moon	It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the sunlight regularly, it grows up with vivid coloration.	753
7082	sword	When bathed in sunlight, this Pokémon emits a pleasantly sweet scent, which causes bug Pokémon to gather around it.	753
7083	shield	During the day, Fomantis basks in sunlight and sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around at night.	753
7084	sun	It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis’s vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this work and treat it as their hobby.	754
7085	moon	It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals. These beams are powerful enough to cleave through thick metal plates.	754
7086	ultra-sun	For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug Pokémon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals.	754
7087	ultra-moon	As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon.	754
7088	sword	This Pokémon resembles a beautiful flower. A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous, brilliant colors.	754
7089	shield	The petals on this Pokémon’s arms are thin and super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if Lurantis gathers light first.	754
7090	sun	It scatters spores that flicker and glow. Anyone seeing these lights falls into a deep slumber.	755
7091	moon	As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall of night, wandering off in search of a new tree.	755
7092	ultra-sun	It scatters its shining spores around itself. Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours of forests where Morelull live are popular.	755
7093	ultra-moon	It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow.	755
7094	sword	Pokémon living in the forest eat the delicious caps on Morelull’s head. The caps regrow overnight.	755
7095	shield	Morelull live in forests that stay dark even during the day. They scatter flickering spores that put enemies to sleep.	755
7096	sun	Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.	756
7097	moon	It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.	756
7098	ultra-sun	It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality.	756
7099	ultra-moon	When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!	756
7100	sword	Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.	756
7101	shield	If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.	756
7102	sun	It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous gas. When its enemies become disoriented from inhaling the gas, it attacks them.	757
7103	moon	Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home. It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them.	757
7104	ultra-sun	The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve.	757
7105	ultra-moon	It weakens opponents and sends them reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t deal well with Spinda, since it’s always reeling.	757
7106	sword	Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this Pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail. This process creates Salandit’s poisonous gas.	757
7107	shield	This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the prey even realizes Salandit is there.	757
7108	sun	For some reason, only females have been found. It creates a reverse harem of male Salandit that it lives with.	758
7109	moon	Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can be diluted to use in the production of luscious perfumes.	758
7110	ultra-sun	Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones to serve it.	758
7111	ultra-moon	It punishes Salandit that couldn’t bring it food with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm.	758
7112	sword	Only female Salazzle exist. They emit a gas laden with pheromones to captivate male Salandit.	758
7113	shield	The winner of competitions between Salazzle is decided by which one has the most male Salandit with it.	758
7114	sun	Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets angry and flails about, its arms and legs could knock a pro wrestler sprawling.	759
7115	moon	A touch from anyone except a known friend sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly dangerous Pokémon.	759
7116	ultra-sun	It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.	759
7117	ultra-moon	Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with amazing power.	759
7118	sword	Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly reaching out to touch this Pokémon could result in painful retaliation.	759
7119	shield	The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is flailing that can snap thick tree trunks.	759
7120	sun	This immensely dangerous Pokémon possesses overwhelming physical strength. Its habitat is generally off-limits.	760
7121	moon	This Pokémon has the habit of hugging its companions. Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug.	760
7122	ultra-sun	It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t run away as fast as possible.	760
7123	ultra-moon	It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in the Alola region.	760
7124	sword	Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones.	760
7125	shield	The moves it uses to take down its prey would make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued prey under its arms to carry them to its nest.	760
7126	sun	A delectable aroma pours from its body. They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon lured by that wafting deliciousness.	761
7127	moon	Although it’s too sugary for human consumption, Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a juice with just the right amount of sweetness.	761
7128	ultra-sun	Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not intelligent enough to care.	761
7129	ultra-moon	It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head. It’s usually a fruitless attempt.	761
7130	sword	Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon.	761
7131	shield	When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it.	761
7132	sun	The sepals on its head developed to protect its body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked by bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine.	762
7133	moon	This Pokémon is always bouncing around energetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by its lively appearance and pleasant aroma.	762
7134	ultra-sun	It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn’t care.	762
7135	ultra-moon	It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its head with abandon. They’re quite painful when they smack you!	762
7136	sword	As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will feel a surge of happiness.	762
7137	shield	Any Corvisquire that pecks at this Pokémon will be greeted with a smack from its sepals followed by a sharp kick.	762
7138	sun	Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously.	763
7139	moon	A Pokémon known for the beauty of its well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a mascot in advertisements for beauty salons.	763
7140	ultra-sun	A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can knock out even kickboxing champions with a single blow.	763
7141	ultra-moon	A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it kicks an opponent.	763
7142	sword	This feared Pokémon has long, slender legs and a cruel heart. It shows no mercy as it stomps on its opponents.	763
7143	shield	A kick from the hardened tips of this Pokémon’s legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and soul that will never heal.	763
7144	sun	It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine. This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off an aromatic scent.	764
7145	moon	Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine have a relaxing effect, so this Pokémon is a hit with many people.	764
7146	ultra-sun	It stretches sticky vines out from its head and picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy.	764
7147	ultra-moon	It picks flowers and sticks them to its body with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts from its petals has a healing effect.	764
7148	sword	Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t wither once they’re attached to a Comfey.	764
7149	shield	These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has its own individual scent.	764
7150	sun	Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s best suited to veteran Trainers.	765
7151	moon	Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this Pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up at the beach to match wits with Slowking.	765
7152	ultra-sun	It normally spends its time meditating in the treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other Pokémon orders as it pleases.	765
7153	ultra-moon	Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so they’re always engaging in battles of wits to decide which one is superior.	765
7154	sword	With waves of its fan—made from leaves and its own fur—Oranguru skillfully gives instructions to other Pokémon.	765
7155	shield	It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes across a wounded Pokémon, Oranguru will gather medicinal herbs to treat it.	765
7156	sun	They form groups of roughly 20 individuals. Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never let down a comrade.	766
7157	moon	They battle with hard berries for weapons. Their techniques are passed from the boss to the group, generation upon generation.	766
7158	ultra-sun	They use their saliva to stick leaves to their shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong to from the position of the leaves.	766
7159	ultra-moon	Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of its diet. The one that can throw a berry the farthest is the boss of the troop.	766
7160	sword	Displaying amazing teamwork, they follow the orders of their boss as they all help out in the search for their favorite berries.	766
7161	shield	Passimian live in groups of about 20, with each member performing an assigned role. Through cooperation, the group survives.	766
7162	sun	This Pokémon is a coward. As it desperately dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a sparkling clean path in its wake.	767
7163	moon	Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds. A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down on anything edible, no matter how rotten.	767
7164	ultra-sun	It will pick up anything it finds on the ground. Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and Meowth will go after it.	767
7165	ultra-moon	An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if anything comes near it.	767
7166	sword	It’s nature’s cleaner—it eats anything and everything, including garbage and rotten things. The ground near its nest is always clean.	767
7167	shield	Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the lookout for danger. They scatter the moment they detect an enemy’s presence.	767
7168	sun	With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two.	768
7169	moon	It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends most of its time peacefully meditating in caves deep beneath the sea.	768
7170	ultra-sun	The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it takes to win.	768
7171	ultra-moon	Its claws, which it can extend and retract at will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod.	768
7172	sword	It will do anything to win, taking advantage of every opening and finishing opponents off with the small claws on its front legs.	768
7173	shield	They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal.	768
7174	sun	Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of the departed.	769
7175	moon	It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body.	769
7176	ultra-sun	It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back.	769
7177	ultra-moon	If you build sand mounds when you’re playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become Sandygast.	769
7178	sword	Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of sand and become a Pokémon. Sandygast is fond of the shovel on its head.	769
7179	shield	Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes control of anyone who puts their hand into its mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger.	769
7180	sun	Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger.	770
7181	moon	Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained.	770
7182	ultra-sun	Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they’re still alive.	770
7183	ultra-moon	Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying Pokémon snatches away their vitality.	770
7184	sword	Palossand is known as the Beach Nightmare. It pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls.	770
7185	shield	This Pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain.	770
7186	shield	It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist, allowing it to stay on land for days without drying up.	771
7187	sun	It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies.	771
7188	moon	These Pokémon line the beaches. The sticky mucous that covers their bodies can be used to soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!	771
7189	ultra-sun	The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore.	771
7190	ultra-moon	Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will get mad and smack you!	771
7191	sword	It lives in warm, shallow waters. If it encounters a foe, it will spit out its internal organs as a means to punch them.	771
7192	sun	The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its intrinsic capabilities. This Pokémon has some hidden special power.	772
7193	moon	Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask to restrain its power.	772
7194	ultra-sun	A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen.	772
7195	ultra-moon	There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask.	772
7196	sword	Rumor has it that the theft of top-secret research notes led to a new instance of this Pokémon being created in the Galar region.	772
7197	shield	It was modeled after a mighty Pokémon of myth. The mask placed upon it limits its power in order to keep it under control.	772
7198	sun	Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This Pokémon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle.	773
7199	moon	Although its name was Type: Null at first, the boy who evolved it into this form gave it the name by which it is now known.	773
7200	ultra-sun	This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased.	773
7201	ultra-moon	Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask.	773
7202	sword	A solid bond of trust between this Pokémon and its Trainer awakened the strength hidden within Silvally. It can change its type at will.	773
7203	shield	The final factor needed to release this Pokémon’s true power was a strong bond with a Trainer it trusts.	773
7204	sun	Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy.	774
7205	moon	Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles.	774
7206	ultra-sun	It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground.	774
7207	ultra-moon	Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens.	774
7208	sun	It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its movements are apparently no more than the results of it tossing and turning in its dreams.	775
7209	moon	The log it holds was given to it by its parents at birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm of a friendly Trainer.	775
7210	ultra-sun	It stays asleep from the moment it’s born. When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether.	775
7211	ultra-moon	It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet.	775
7212	sun	The shell on its back is chemically unstable and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its stomach is its weak point.	776
7213	moon	It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and can be put to various uses.	776
7214	ultra-sun	It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.	776
7215	ultra-moon	Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves.	776
7216	sword	Explosive substances coat the shell on its back. Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away by an immense detonation.	776
7217	shield	Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive.	776
7218	sun	The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest. When this Pokémon becomes agitated, its fur stands on end and stabs into its attackers.	777
7219	moon	The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods. The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as energy in its electric sac.	777
7220	ultra-sun	When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily.	777
7221	ultra-moon	Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!	777
7222	sword	With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac.	777
7223	shield	When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately.	777
7224	sun	Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.	778
7225	moon	A lonely Pokémon, it conceals its terrifying appearance beneath an old rag so it can get closer to people and other Pokémon.	778
7226	ultra-sun	Although it’s a quiet, lonely Pokémon, if you try to look at what’s under its rag, it will become agitated and resist violently.	778
7227	ultra-moon	A gust of wind revealed what hides under this Pokémon’s rag to a passing Trainer, who went home and died painfully that very night.	778
7228	sword	It wears a rag fashioned into a Pikachu costume in an effort to look less scary. Unfortunately, the costume only makes it creepier.	778
7229	shield	There was a scientist who peeked under Mimikyu’s old rag in the name of research. The scientist died of a mysterious disease.	778
7230	sun	When it unleashes its psychic power from the protuberance on its head, the grating sound of grinding teeth echoes through the area.	779
7231	moon	It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then grinds them to mush with its strong teeth. Even Shellder’s shell is no match for it.	779
7232	ultra-sun	It burrows beneath the sand, radiating psychic power from the protuberance on its head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area.	779
7233	ultra-moon	Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches up the spikes and eats them.	779
7234	sun	It has a compassionate personality, but if it is angered, it completely destroys its surroundings with its intense breath.	780
7235	moon	This Pokémon is friendly to people and loves children most of all. It comes from deep in the mountains to play with children it likes in town.	780
7236	ultra-sun	If a child it has made friends with is bullied, Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to the ground.	780
7237	ultra-moon	It appears in towns and plays with the children. Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger, so their moms don’t have to worry.	780
7238	sword	The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play with the children living in the towns below.	780
7239	shield	Drampa is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a gale and flattens everything around.	780
7240	sun	Swinging its massive anchor, it can KO Wailord in a single blow. What appears to be green seaweed is actually its body.	781
7241	moon	The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became reborn as this Pokémon. It maintains itself with new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed.	781
7242	ultra-sun	It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks away their vitality. It only likes to go after big prey like Wailord.	781
7243	ultra-moon	Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch outward for hundreds of yards. For some reason, it gets along well with Skrelp.	781
7244	sword	After a piece of seaweed merged with debris from a sunken ship, it was reborn as this ghost Pokémon.	781
7245	shield	After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It catches large Wailord and drains their life-force.	781
7246	sun	It expresses its feelings by smacking its scales. Metallic sounds echo through the tall mountains where Jangmo-o lives.	782
7247	moon	They live in mountains where no trace of humans can be detected. Jangmo-o grow little by little as they battle one another.	782
7248	ultra-sun	It smacks the scales on its head against rocks or against the ground to frighten its opponents. It can also contact its friends with these noises.	782
7249	ultra-moon	It will never show an enemy its back in battle. Ancient warriors liked Jangmo-o for its valiant disposition and made it one of their own.	782
7250	sword	They learn to fight by smashing their head scales together. The dueling strengthens both their skills and their spirits.	782
7251	shield	Jangmo-o strikes its scales to communicate with others of its kind. Its scales are actually fur that’s become as hard as metal.	782
7252	sun	It leaps at its prey with a courageous shout. Its scaly punches tear its opponents to shreds.	783
7253	moon	It sheds and regrows its scales on a continuous basis. The scales become harder and sharper each time they’re regrown.	783
7254	ultra-sun	It makes noise by clanging its scales together. When the rhythm has reached its peak, Hakamo-o attacks.	783
7255	ultra-moon	The scales it sheds can be molded and processed to make pots and pans. They conduct heat well, so they’re a popular item.	783
7256	sword	The scaleless, scarred parts of its body are signs of its strength. It shows them off to defeated opponents.	783
7257	shield	Before attacking its enemies, it clashes its scales together and roars. Its sharp claws shred the opposition.	783
7258	sun	When it spots enemies, it threatens them by jingling the scales on its tail. Weak opponents will crack and flee in panic.	784
7259	moon	Its rigid scales function as offense and defense. In the past, its scales were processed and used to make weapons and other commodities.	784
7260	ultra-sun	When it howls after finishing off its prey, the metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can be heard from all around.	784
7261	ultra-moon	It battles valiantly with its fists, which are armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes in uppercuts.	784
7262	sword	It clatters its tail scales to unnerve opponents. This Pokémon will battle only those who stand steadfast in the face of this display.	784
7263	shield	Certain ruins have paintings of ancient warriors wearing armor made of Kommo-o scales.	784
7264	sun	This guardian deity of Melemele is brimming with curiosity. It summons thunderclouds and stores their lightning inside its body.	785
7265	moon	It confuses its enemies by flying too quickly for the eye to follow. It has a hair-trigger temper but forgets what made it angry an instant later.	785
7266	ultra-sun	Although it’s called a guardian deity, if a person or Pokémon puts it in a bad mood, it will become a malevolent deity and attack.	785
7267	ultra-moon	The lightning-wielding guardian deity of Melemele, Tapu Koko is brimming with curiosity and appears before people from time to time.	785
7268	sun	This guardian deity of Akala is guilelessly cruel. The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of its energy.	786

7270	ultra-sun	It heals the wounds of people and Pokémon by sprinkling them with its sparkling scales. This guardian deity is worshiped on Akala.	786
7271	ultra-moon	Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is devoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and can be described as nature incarnate.	786
7272	sun	It pulls large trees up by the roots and swings them around. It causes vegetation to grow, and then it absorbs energy from the growth.	787

7275	ultra-moon	It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts. This guardian deity of Ula’ula controls plants.	787

7277	moon	The guardian deity of Poni, it can control water. People say it can create pure water that will wash away any uncleanness.	788
7278	ultra-sun	This guardian deity of Poni Island manipulates water. Because it lives deep within a thick fog, it came to be both feared and revered.	788
7279	ultra-moon	Although it’s called a guardian deity, terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini.	788
7280	sun	Its body is gaseous and frail. It slowly grows as it collects dust from the atmosphere.	789
7281	moon	In ages past, it was called the child of the stars. It’s said to be a Pokémon from another world, but no specific details are known.	789
7282	ultra-sun	Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn’t seem to care.	789
7283	ultra-moon	Whether or not it’s a Pokémon from this world is a mystery. When it’s in a jam, it warps away to a safe place to hide.	789
7284	sword	This Pokémon came from another universe. Its gaseous body is so light that even a gentle breeze can blow it away.	789
7285	shield	Cosmog is very curious but not very cautious, often placing itself in danger. If things start to look dicey, it teleports away.	789
7286	sun	Motionless as if dead, its body is faintly warm to the touch. In the distant past, it was called the cocoon of the stars.	790
7287	moon	There’s something accumulating around the black core within its hard shell. People think this Pokémon may come from another world.	790
7288	ultra-sun	The king who ruled Alola in times of antiquity called it the “cocoon of the stars” and built an altar to worship it.	790
7289	ultra-moon	As it absorbs light, Cosmoem continues to grow. Its golden shell is surprisingly solid.	790
7290	sword	The absorption of starlight fuels this Pokémon’s growth. The shell that encases it is harder than any known material.	790
7291	shield	It sucks in dust from the air at an astounding rate, frantically building up energy within its core as preparation for evolution.	790

7336	sword	It survives by absorbing light. After a long time spent slumbering underground, impurities accumulated within it, causing its body to darken.	800
7337	shield	It needs light to survive, and it goes on a rampage seeking it out. Its laser beams will cut anything to pieces.	800
7338	sun	This artificial Pokémon, constructed more than 500 years ago, can understand human speech but cannot itself speak.	801
7339	moon	Its mechanized body is merely a vessel. Its true self is its Soul-Heart, an artificial soul.	801
7340	ultra-sun	It synchronizes its consciousness with others to understand their feelings. This faculty makes it useful for taking care of people.	801
7341	ultra-moon	Built roughly 500 years ago by a scientist, the part called the Soul-Heart is the actual life-form.	801
7342	sun	Able to conceal itself in shadows, it never appears before humans, so its very existence was the stuff of myth.	802
7343	moon	It lurks in the shadows of others, copying their movements and powers. This Pokémon is craven and cowering.	802
7344	ultra-sun	It slips into the shadows of others and mimics their powers and movements. As it improves, it becomes stronger than those it’s imitating.	802
7345	ultra-moon	It sinks into the shadows of people and Pokémon, where it can understand their feelings and copy their capabilities.	802
7346	sword	By slipping into the shadow of a martial arts master and copying their movements, this Pokémon learned the ultimate techniques.	802
7347	shield	This Pokémon can conceal itself in any shadow, so it went undiscovered for a long time.	802
7348	ultra-sun	This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be chosen as a first partner in its own world.	803
7349	ultra-moon	An Ultra Beast that lives in a different world, it cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with poison from the needles on its head.	803
7350	ultra-sun	It stores hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid inside its body. It is one of the organisms known as UBs.	804
7351	ultra-moon	One kind of Ultra Beast, it fires a glowing, venomous liquid from its needles. This liquid is also immensely adhesive.	804
7352	ultra-sun	It appeared from an Ultra Wormhole. Each one appears to be made up of many life-forms stacked one on top of each other.	805
7353	ultra-moon	When stone walls started moving and attacking, the brute’s true identity was this mysterious life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast.	805
7354	ultra-sun	It slithers toward people. Then, without warning, it triggers the explosion of its own head. It’s apparently one kind of Ultra Beast.	806
7355	ultra-moon	A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it causes explosions, then takes advantage of opponents’ surprise to rob them of their vitality.	806
7356	ultra-sun	It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack, they’ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks.	807
7357	ultra-moon	It approaches its enemies at the speed of lightning, then tears them limb from limb with its sharp claws.	807
7358	sword	It runs as fast as lightning strikes, shredding its opponents with its high-voltage claws.	807
7359	shield	Electricity sparks from the pads on its limbs. Wherever Zeraora runs, lightning flashes and thunder echoes.	807
7360	lets-go-pikachu	It melts particles of iron and other metals found in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its body of molten steel.	808
7361	lets-go-eevee	It melts particles of iron and other metals found in the subsoil, so it can absorb them into its body of molten steel.	808
7362	sword	It dissolves and eats metal. Circulating liquid metal within its body is how it generates energy.	808
7363	shield	They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong Meltan will absorb all the others and evolve.	808
7364	lets-go-pikachu	Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron from nothing, for some reason it has come back to life after 3,000 years.	809
7365	lets-go-eevee	Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron from nothing, for some reason it has come back to life after 3,000 years.	809
7366	sword	At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and fall apart. The small shards left behind will eventually be reborn as Meltan.	809
7367	shield	Centrifugal force is behind the punches of Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.	809
